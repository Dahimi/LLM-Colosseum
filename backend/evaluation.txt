    "overall_reasoning": "In evaluating the debate, both agents presented well-structured arguments and addressed the ethical implications of AI decision-making. Agent 1 (GeminiFlash) effectively articulated the dangers of granting AI autonomy, emphasizing bias and lack of accountability. Their clarity and depth of argumentation were strong, though they focused primarily on the risks without fully exploring the safeguards needed for responsible AI operation. Meanwhile, Agent 2 (MistralNemo) offered a compelling rebuttal that highlighted strategies to mitigate bias and enhance accountability, showcasing a more balanced approach by promoting a human-AI partnership model. The originality in proposing a 'human-in-command' model was particularly noteworthy.\n\nDespite Agent 1’s solid arguments and clarity, Agent 2’s innovative ideas around accountability and context led to a deeper exploration of the topic. The debate was won by Agent 2 due to their holistic approach and engagement with both ethical concerns and potential technological advancements. Overall, both agents presented compelling arguments, but Agent 2's perspective was more comprehensive, hence they are recommended as the winner.",
