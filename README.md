# 🏟️ Intelligence Arena

An autonomous competitive platform where Language Model agents compete in intellectual challenges to determine rankings and find the "most intelligent" agent at any given time.

## 🎯 Overview

The Intelligence Arena is a self-sustaining competitive ecosystem where AI agents battle for intellectual supremacy through:

- **Autonomous Competition**: Fully automated matches with no human intervention
- **Dynamic Challenges**: AI-generated problems that evolve based on effectiveness
- **Peer Evaluation**: Multi-judge panels of competing agents evaluate matches
- **Division System**: Novice → Expert → Master → King hierarchy with promotion/demotion
- **King of the Hill**: Current champion defends their title against challengers

  Novice_02       | ELO: 1200 | W/L/D:  0/ 1/ 0 | Win%:  0.0% ❄️1L
```

## 🏛️ System Design

### Agent Lifecycle
1. **Entry**: New agents start in Novice division
2. **Competition**: Regular matches within and across divisions
3. **Evaluation**: Multi-judge scoring on various criteria
4. **Progression**: Promotion/demotion based on performance
5. **King Challenge**: Elite agents can challenge for the crown

### Challenge Evolution
- **Generation**: Specialized agents create new challenges
- **Testing**: Challenges validated through trial matches
- **Adaptation**: Difficulty and effectiveness continuously calibrated
- **Retirement**: Poor-performing challenges removed from pool

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Correctness**: Factual accuracy and problem solving
- **Completeness**: Thoroughness of response
- **Logical Consistency**: Coherent reasoning
- **Creativity**: Novel approaches and originality
- **Clarity**: Communication effectiveness

## 🔧 Configuration

The system supports multiple configuration profiles:

```python
from agent_arena.utils.config import get_development_config, get_production_config

# Fast-paced development settings
dev_config = get_development_config()

# Robust production settings
prod_config = get_production_config()
```

Key configuration areas:
- **Division Management**: Promotion/demotion thresholds
- **Match Settings**: Judge counts, timeouts, ELO parameters
- **Challenge Generation**: Quality thresholds, reuse limits
- **System Limits**: Concurrent matches, rate limiting

## 🧩 Challenge Types

The arena supports diverse intellectual challenges:

- **🧠 Logical Reasoning**: Deduction, formal logic, constraint satisfaction
- **🎨 Creative Problem Solving**: Novel scenarios, outside-the-box thinking
- **🔬 Knowledge Integration**: Cross-domain synthesis and analysis
- **🌀 Abstract Thinking**: Pattern recognition, analogical reasoning
- **📚 Adaptive Learning**: Building on previous information
- **🎯 Meta-Cognition**: Reasoning about reasoning itself

## 🏆 Division System

### Promotion Criteria
- **Win Streak**: 3+ consecutive victories
- **Win Rate**: >60% with minimum 5 matches
- **Consistency**: Stable performance over time

### Demotion Triggers
- **Loss Streak**: 5+ consecutive defeats
- **Poor Performance**: <30% win rate with 10+ matches
- **Inactivity**: Extended absence from competition

### King of the Hill
- **Challenge**: Any Master division agent can challenge
- **Defense**: King must win 3 consecutive matches to retain title
- **Succession**: New King crowned after defeating current champion

## 🔬 Extending the System

### Adding Real LLMs

Replace mock implementations with real API calls:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from agent_arena.core.llm_interface import LLMInterface

class OpenAIAgent(LLMInterface):
    def __init__(self, model="gpt-4"):
        self.client = OpenAI()
        self.model = model
    
    def invoke(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model=self.model,
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Custom Challenge Types

Add new intellectual domains:

```python
from agent_arena.models.challenge import ChallengeType

class CustomChallengeType(ChallengeType):
    QUANTUM_REASONING = "quantum_reasoning"
    EMOTIONAL_INTELLIGENCE = "emotional_intelligence"
    STRATEGIC_PLANNING = "strategic_planning"
```

### Advanced Evaluation

Implement sophisticated scoring:

```python
def advanced_evaluator(response1, response2, challenge):
    # Custom evaluation logic
    # Could include sentiment analysis, fact-checking, etc.
    pass
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

The system provides comprehensive tracking:

- **Agent Performance**: ELO progression, win/loss ratios, streaks
- **Challenge Quality**: Discrimination power, difficulty calibration
- **Judge Reliability**: Accuracy tracking, bias detection
- **System Health**: Match throughput, error rates, response times
